# Pandas Practice Project


The purpose of this project is to perform an EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on the San Francisco Salaries dataset obtained from Kaggle.
One way to understand how a city government works is by looking at who it employs and how its employees are compensated. 
This data contains the Names, Job Title, Basepay and Compensation for employees on an annual basis from 2011 to 2014.

Here are some of the information I was able to explore:

* What was the average (mean) BasePay of all employees per year? (2011-2014) 
* What is the name of highest paid person (including benefits)?
* What are the top 5 most common jobs?
* Is there a corellation between the Basepay and TotalPaybenfits?

An in-depth description of the data, variables and statistics can be found on
